"EU Gun Control: After Terrorism And Sex Assaults, European Union Cracks Down On Firearms Ownership","Gun collectors could be forced to apply for a licence and undergo backgroundchecks even if they only own deactivated weapons if European Union (EU) officials get their way. Critics have called the proposed legislation &quot;excessive,&quot; and have accused the EU of harassing responsible gun owners. EU officials have deemed the last round of regulations, introduced in 2008, to be inadequate, claiming that they leave Europe &quot;vulnerable to criminal activity.&quot; European leaders have agreed, vowing in the wake of the Paris attacks to &quot;rapidly examine&quot; the new proposals with the intention of approving them. Among other measures, the draft law will ban the ownership of all Category A firearms throughout the European Member States, even when such guns are deactivated.<br><br> In addition, all licence holders will need to reapply every five years, and a &quot;standard medical test&quot; for all applicants will be rolled out. Firearms dealers and brokers will also face stricter controls and for the first time will be forced to comply with &quot;competence checks&quot; in addition to criminal and safety checks, which would include checks on the &quot;private and professional integrity&quot; of dealers and their staff. And the legislation will outlaw a range of weapons, including a ban on all semi-automatic firearms which look like military weapons. Blank-firing weapons and other replica weapons would also be caught by the legislation.<br><br> The Austrian gun lobby has been forthcoming in its condemnation of the measures. They have slammed the proposals for all gun owners to pass medical tests as &quot;harassment,&quot; and the proposals in general as &quot;excessive&quot;. The secretary of Austria’s gun lobby organisation IWO said that many women had been buying weapons following the attacks which took place across Europe on New Year’s Eve. The new laws, he said, would see these women and &quot;a large number of otherwise law-abiding citizens unknowingly criminalized&quot;.<br><br> In a recent blog on the IWO site, he added: &quot;And the advice you get is useless, stupid and dangerous. Judging by the &quot;experts&quot;, women should not defend themselves, they should hand over all possessions when confronted (by a criminal), they must not obstruct their escape routes, and they must endure sexual assaults defenceless.

Finally start to lay down your victimhood!&quot;<br><br> Between 2001 and 2014, the number of crimes committed by foreigners in Austria increased by a staggering 90 percent. By comparison, the rise in crime within the Austrian population during the same period was just six percent. &quot;The additional 200,000 plus of foreign refugees known to have entered the country has a lot of people worried,&quot; one police officer confided.

"If conservatives want to keep their guns, they’re going to have to find a way to stop mass shootings","When it comes to gun control, conservatives have been fortunate in their enemies. Every time there is a mass shooting, the left renews its calls for gun control, but it spends a great deal of energy on futile and ahistorical arguments about the wording of the Second Amendment, or making hackle-raising, invidious comparisons with Europe. And when it comes time to actually suggest what should be done, Democrats generally suggest policies recycled from the 1994 crime bill, such as background checks and a ban on assault weapons. There’s little evidence that these policies did anything to curb gun violence the first time they were tried, which undercuts the calls for redoubling those efforts.<br><br> Yes, conservatives have been fortunate in their opponents. But when it comes to gun control, the right has been equally unfortunate in its allies, and in the end, that may matter much more. Forget the arguments about whether President Trump’s rhetoric about immigrants did or didn’t cause the alleged El Paso shooter to go on a murderous rampage. I’m talking about a much more treacherous conservative ally: the National Rifle Association.<br><br> Every time there’s a mass shooting, the NRA rushes to suggest that the real problem is mental illness or violent video games or anything except guns. These claims have little evidence behind them, but of course that’s beside the point — the NRA just wants to say something that sounds vaguely plausible and doesn’t involve restricting guns. And that single-minded focus on simply avoiding gun restrictions has carried them to victory after victory.<br><br> Unfortunately, when crime rates began to rise, the timing made it look as if liberal policies were the culprit. That was probably unfair, but by the 1990s, the country was too frightened to listen to any more liberals murmuring about how hard criminals had it. Thus, the 1994 crime bill.<br><br> Many of the policies in that bill failed. The longer sentences didn’t do much to deter criminals, and the gun-control measures didn’t do much to reduce gun violence. But the American public wasn’t going to give the left another 50 years to work on crime’s &quot;root causes.&quot;<br><br> The right should take note: Just as Americans were not going to let their cities turn into slaughterhouses, they are not going to let their Walmarts become war zones.<br><br> If tragedies keep happening at the current rate, the American public is eventually going to demand that the government take guns out of private hands. None of the firewalls that have worked thus far will hold. Constitutions can be amended, or courts packed with judges who read them differently.

Every time there is a mass shooting, the left renews its calls for gun control, but it spends a great deal of energy on <span class='annotation'>futile and ahistorical arguments</span><span class='annotation-text'>Subjective statement</span> about the wording of the Second Amendment, or making <span class='annotation'>hackle-raising, invidious</span><span class='annotation-text'>Subjective statement</span> comparisons with Europe. And when it comes time to actually suggest what should be done, Democrats generally suggest policies recycled from the 1994 crime bill, such as background checks and a ban on assault weapons. There’s little evidence that these policies did anything to curb gun violence the first time they were tried, which undercuts the calls for redoubling those efforts.<br><br> Yes, conservatives have been <span class='annotation'>fortunate</span><span class='annotation-text'>Subjective statement, Repetition</span> in their opponents. But when it comes to gun control, the right has been equally unfortunate in its allies, and in the end, that may matter much more. Forget the arguments about whether President Trump’s rhetoric about immigrants did or didn’t cause the alleged El Paso shooter to go on a murderous rampage. I’m talking about a much more <span class='annotation'>treacherous</span><span class='annotation-text'>Subjective term</span> conservative ally: the National Rifle Association.<br><br> Every time there’s a mass shooting, the NRA <span class='annotation'>rushes to suggest</span><span class='annotation-text'>Subjective statement</span> that the real problem is mental illness or violent video games or anything except guns. These claims have little evidence behind them, but of course that’s beside the point — <span class='annotation'>the NRA just wants to say something that sounds vaguely plausible and doesn’t involve restricting guns</span><span class='annotation-text'>Unfounded claim</span>. And that <span class='annotation'>single-minded</span><span class='annotation-text'>Subjective term</span> focus on <span class='annotation'>simply avoiding</span><span class='annotation-text'>Subjective term</span> gun restrictions has carried them to victory after victory.<br><br> <span class='annotation'>Unfortunately</span><span class='annotation-text'>Subjective term</span>, when crime rates began to rise, the timing made it look as if liberal policies were the culprit. That was probably unfair, but by the 1990s, the country was <span class='annotation'>too frightened to listen to any more liberals murmuring</span><span class='annotation-text'>Overgeneralization</span> about how hard criminals had it. Thus, the 1994 crime bill.<br><br> Many of the policies in that bill failed. The longer sentences didn’t do much to deter criminals, and the gun-control measures didn’t do much to reduce gun violence. But the American public wasn’t going to give the left another 50 years to work on crime’s &quot;root causes.&quot;<br><br> The right should take note: Just as Americans were not going to let their cities turn into <span class='annotation'>slaughterhouses</span><span class='annotation-text'>Subjective term</span>, they are not going to let their Walmarts become <span class='annotation'>war zones</span><span class='annotation-text'>Subjective term</span>.<br><br> If tragedies keep happening at the current rate, the American public is eventually going to demand that the government take guns out of private hands. None of the firewalls that have worked thus far will hold. Constitutions can be amended, or courts packed with judges who read them differently. <span class='annotation'>Even seemingly impregnable political coalitions can be broken by the weight of enough dead bodies</span><span class='annotation-text'>Subjective statement</span>.
